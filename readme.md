ShayaX's Solarized Dark Theme for Brackets
==================
This theme is a modified theme based on Ethan Schoonover's (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color pallete and Jacob Lauritzen's (https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) themes-for-brackets (https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets).

How to install
==================
* Install themes-for-brackets either from Brackets' Extension Manager or GitHub (https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets)
* Manually copy/paste the "themesforbrackets" folder from this repo into your Brackets extension foler located at C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Brackets\extensions\user
 - I am too lazy to make it more simple. XD
* BONUS: I have included a modified custom-work-for-brackets (https://github.com/DH3ALEJANDRO/custom-work-for-brackets) stylesheet for this theme.
